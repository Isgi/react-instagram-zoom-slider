# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in react-instagram-zoom-slider! You are very welcome to contribute.

If you are proposing a new feature, make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/skozer/react-instagram-zoom-slider/issues/new/choose) to make sure it is inline with the project goals.









## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local device:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/react-instagram-zoom-slider.git
    cd react-instagram-zoom-slider
    ```

2. Install and build the library in watch mode:

    ```bash
    yarn
    yarn start
    ```

3. In another terminal, install and build the example app in watch mode:

    ```bash
    cd example
    yarn
    yarn start
    ```
    
4. Open the dev server in your browser:

    > http://localhost:1234


Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, your local dev server will live-reload so you can iterate on the library in real-time.
